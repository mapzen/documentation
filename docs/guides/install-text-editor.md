# Install a text editor

A text editor is an application that will allow you to edit plain text files.  

While you can use the apps installed with your operating system, such as Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Mac, they do not provide the helpful indentations, code coloring and autocomplete, or text alignment options found in the other editors. To use TextEdit, you must go to the Format menu and click Make Plain Text to use the plain-text version of the file. 

Do not use an app that applies rich formatting, such as Microsoft Word or Wordpad. These rich text editors include formatting that will confuse your code.

Here are a few recommended editors:

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Mac, Windows, Linux) 
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (Mac, Windows, Linux; free trial) 
* [Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/) (Windows only) 
* [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/) (Mac only)
